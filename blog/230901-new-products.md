We've changed the way we organise our products to make Codat easier than ever to use.

The standardized Codat Accounting, Banking, and Commerce APIs you might be familiar with have a large array of functionality, but it can be difficult to know how to how to use them to achieve what you're trying to achieve.

**We've repackaged all the functionality you're using today into a new, clearer set of products aligned to the your usecase.**

## What's changed?

- Assess is now part of our [Lending API](/lending/overview), and enhances the existing powerful Assess features with the ability to fetch the underlying financial data.
- If you're [automating payables](/usecases/summary/automating-payables) (for example, paying supplier bills) then our new product [Sync for Payables](/payables/overview) has all the Accounting API features you need.
- If you're [managing payroll](/usecases/summary/managing-payroll) (for example, reconciling payroll within a user's accounting platform), try our [Sync for Payroll](/payroll/overview) product.

Our existing Sync for Commerce, Sync for Expenses, and Bank Feeds API products remain unchanged.

Each of these new products comes equipped with an [SDK libraries](/get-started/libraries) to get you up and running asap, including our brand new [C# libraries](https://github.com/codatio/client-sdk-csharp).

## What does this mean for you?
