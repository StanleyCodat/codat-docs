We've improved our QuickBooks Desktop integration utilizing Intuit's Web Connector for a simpler and faster SMB link journey.

//**Any headline to call out?**

## What's changed?

- We have reduced the number of steps for SMB users in the link flow
- We have removed the prerequisite steps to run the connector on Right Networks or QuickBooks Enterprise for cloud
- We have improved maintainability and observability of the link flow

## What does this mean for you?

An all round better client and SMB user experience connecting to QuickBooks Desktop
