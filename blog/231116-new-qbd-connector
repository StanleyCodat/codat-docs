We've released a new QuickBooks Desktop integration utilizing Intuit's Web Connector for a simpler and faster SMB link journey.

As of xxx date all new connections to QBD will use this new flow.

<!--truncate-->

## What's changed?

- Replaced the existing bespoke Codat connector application used in the link flow with Intuit's QuickBooks Web Connector.
- Reduced the number of installation steps for SMB users in the link flow and moved this to a web browser.
- Simplified the process to connect to a QuickBooks Desktop instance on hosted environments Right Networks and QuickBooks Enterprise for cloud, now you no longer need to go through the RN application process.
- Better diagnostics to triage connector issues.

More details can be found in [QuickBooks Desktop (on-premise)](https://docs.codat.io/integrations/accounting/quickbooksdesktop/accounting-quickbooksdesktop)

## What does this mean for you?

If you have existing QBD connections share the existing link url with your SMB customers, this will initiate the new flow, completition of which will establish the new connector.
