On October 10, 2023, Codat will change the mappings for contra manual journals on the billPayments and payments datatypes.

<!--truncate-->

Manual Journal Contra (offsetting AP against AR) entries will no longer be mapped to Codat's billPayments and payments data model. These manual journal entries will be found in the journalEntries datatype.
