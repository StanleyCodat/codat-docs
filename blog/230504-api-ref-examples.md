We've added examples to our create, update, get and list data type endpoints. This makes it easier for developers to understand the nuiances of requests and response between integrations. Checkout out our [directIncomes](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/operations/create-direct-income) API ref. to see them first hand.
