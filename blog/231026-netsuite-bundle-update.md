We have released a new version of our NetSuite bundle that contains fixes to the display of attachments. 

<!--truncate-->

Previously, users may have experienced an issue where attachments using a `month/day/year` format weren't displaying their `createdDate` and `modifiedDate`. The new v1.23.0 version of the bundle corrects this behavior so the attachments display the `createdDate` and `modifiedDate`.

## Action required

If you use our NetSuite integration and have experienced the issue described above, update your bundle to the newest v1.23.0 version.
