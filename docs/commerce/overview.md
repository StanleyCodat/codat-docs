video_text: What is Sync for Commerce?
---

Accounting for sales is a major pain point for merchants. It usually involves manually porting data from Point of Sale (POS), Payment, and eCommerce platforms into accounting software 

(usually via multiple manual bulk data downloads and manipulation in spreadsheets and within the Accounting software itself). The labour-intensive nature of this work means it is typically done one infrequently, leaving many merchants unable to leverage their Accounting software to effectively understand their business’ performance.

**Sync for Commerce automatically replicates and reconciles sales data from a merchant’s ‘source’ POS, Payments and eCommerce systems into their Accounting software. This eliminates manual processing by merchants, and transforms their ability run and grow their business.**

We do all the heavy lifting, integrating with merchant’s systems and mapping merchant’s data according to accounting best practices so it shows up in their Accounting software in a way that is useful to them and their book-keeper or accountant.

## How does Sync for Commerce work?

### 1. Setup

Quickly and easily implement Sync for Commerce within your software.

To get started, Codat will deploy a simple connector to your API, to allow us to connect to your customer’s data. Your Solutions Engineer will work with you to make this happen. This can usually be completed within a few weeks.

If you don’t have an API already, our Professional Services team can work with you to identify an alterative mechanism to connect to your customer’s data (or even build you and API).

You will need to implement some simple functionality to allow a merchant to begin setting up their sales data synchronization, select the system(s) they’d like to connect, and re-direct users to Codat’s Sync Configuration User Interface (UI)

You can of course customize branding, appearance, and content of the Sync Configuration UI, so it integrates seamlessly into your software.

### 2. Merchant configuration

Once the access is authorized, the merchant can set how the synchronization should work through the Sync configuration flow.

This is how your customers will set up their sales data synchronization.

Once your customer lands on the Sync Configuration UI, we will take them through an onboarding journey, allowing the user to

Authorize access to the required system(s) to which we need to connect, to synchronise sales data

Tell us how they’d like their sales data represented in their Accounting software

In the background, we will retrieve some basic information from their connected systems to allow us to customize this to their specific POS/Payments/e-commerce/Accounting software set up

### 3. Data synchronization

Once the Sync Configuration is completed, we automatically synchronise data after the end of each day.

You can also trigger a sync at any time through the API

### 4. Ongoing support

At any time, a user can revisit the Sync Configuration UI to update their configuration, stop/re-start their automated sales data synchronisation, or revoke access to their systems

Within the Sync Configuration UI, the user can also view completed syncs, and any errors that have occurred

Your support team can view each merchant’s syncs and troubleshoot any errors within the Sync for Commerce Health site, accessed through the Codat Portal.
