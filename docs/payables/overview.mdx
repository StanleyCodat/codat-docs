## How it works

![Sync for Payables](/img/use-cases/summary-pages/d0c6b0b7-automating-payables.png)

### [Connect to your SMB's accounting platform](/auth-flow/overview)

Codat handles authorization and linking to your SMB's accounting platform and takes into account intricate details such as rate limits.

### [Retrieve accounts payable invoices](bills)

A list of unpaid [bills](/accounting-api#/schemas/Bill) (accounts payable invoices) can be retrieved from the accounting platform, in the Accounting API a bill is an itemised record of goods purchased from or services provided by a supplier.
Alternatively, Bills can also be created within your application and then synchronised to the accounting platform.

### [Payment account mapping](mapping)

Once Authorised, you can use the bank accounts endpoint to retrieve a list of accounts which can be mapped enabling the user to dictate which account their payments should be reconciled to.

### [Payment reconciliation](payments)

Once the transaction is completed, a bill payment can then be pushed to the customers accounting platform and reconciled against the bill marking it as paid.
