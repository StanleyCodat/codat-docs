## How does it work?

![Accounts payable workflow supported by Codat](/img/use-cases/summary-pages/d0c6b0b7-automating-payables.png)

### [Configure and connect your customer](/payables/configure-customer)

Start by creating a [company](../terms/company) and establishing its [connection](/core-concepts/connections) to represent your SMB customer and their accounting platform in Codat. Next, let us handle the authorization and linking to that accounting platform - all we need is for your SMB to approve this access via our [auth flow](/auth-flow/overview). 

### [Retrieve accounts payable invoices](/payables/bills)

Fetch a list of your customer's unpaid accounts payable invoices - known in Codat as [bills](../terms/bill) - from their accounting software, or create new ones within your application and synchronize them. 

You can manage your customer's [suppliers](/payables/suppliers) - businesses and sole traders that issue bills to your customer - in the same way, retrieving existing ones or creating new records. 

### [Payment account mapping](/payables/mapping)

Once your SMB customer authorizes access to their accounting software, retrieve a list of their bank accounts and display these in your application's UI. Enable your customer to map which account should be used to pay bills and allow them to create a new account when needed.

### [Payment reconciliation](/payables/payments)

Once the bill payment is complete, reflect this transaction in your customer's accounting platform and reconcile it against the original bill, marking it as paid.
