## Supported outputs

You can retrieve the data pulled and enriched by the feature by calling the **sales** [endpoints of our API](/lending-api#/).

## Get started

Once you have the Lending API enabled, configure your instance to work with our sales feature. 

#### Configure data sources

Follow the respective guides to set up and enable commerce integrations that will serve as a data source for the feature:

<br />

<IntegrationsList integrations={commerceIntegrations} />


#### Enable data types and sync schedule

See how to [enable data types](/core-concepts/data-type-settings#override-the-default-sync-settings) and ensure the following data types have been switched on:

- Customers `commerce-customers`
- Disputes `commerce-disputes`
- Locations `commerce-locations`
- Orders `commerce-orders`
- Payment methods `commerce-paymentMethods`
- Payments `commerce-payments`
- Products `commerce-products`
- Product categories `commerce-productCategories`
- Transactions `commerce-transactions`

Configure the solution to refresh data when you need it by [setting a synchronization frequency](/core-concepts/data-type-settings#choose-a-synchronization-frequency). We recommend setting it to a daily or a monthly sync.

#### Configure webhooks

We recommend you configure the following [webhooks](/using-the-api/webhooks/core-rules-types) to manage your data pipelines. These webhooks send a notification for each `dataType` separately.

- [Dataset status has changed to an error state](/using-the-api/webhooks/core-rules-types#dataset-status-has-changed-to-an-error-state)  

  If you receive a notification from this webhook, it means an issue occured when syncing the specified data type. Resolve the issue and [initiate the sync](/using-the-api/queueing-data-syncs#refresh-data) for this dataset again. 
 
- [Dataset data changed](/using-the-api/webhooks/core-rules-types#dataset-data-changed)  

  If you receive a notification from this webhook, it means data has been updated for the specified data type. This can include new, updated or deleted data. You should then refresh the data in your platform.
