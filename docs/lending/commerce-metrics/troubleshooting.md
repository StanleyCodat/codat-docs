## Required data types

By default, relevant commerce data types are enabled when the Lending API is enabled on your Codat client.
In the event that these are disabled, check that you have the following data types enabled:

- Commerce - Company Info
- Commerce - Customers
- Commerce - Orders

## Supported intergrations

Some commerece integrations do not provide the required data needed to calculate commerce metrics. 
Discover what integrations support commerce metrics by ensuring that the integration supports the required data types defined above.

Check out the [coverage explorer](https://knowledge.codat.io/supported-features/commerce?view=tab-by-integration) for available data types by integration.
