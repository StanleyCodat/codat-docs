There are [two POST endpoints in the API](/codat-api#/operations/create--many-pull-operations) for queuing a refresh of data:

1. `/companies/{companyId}/data/queue/{dataType}`
   - Will queue a dataset for the specified data type
   - _dataType_ is the key of the data type e.g. `invoices`
2. `/companies/{companyId}/data/all`
   - Will queue a dataset for each of the data types marked as _Fetch on first link_ in your [data type settings](/core-concepts/data-type-settings), where that data type is supported by the company's linked data connections

:::info Multiple dataset queued exception

If you try to queue a synchronization for a data type that is already in process, you'll receive an exception.

```
"error": "DatasetAlreadyInProgressException: Cannot queue {dataType} sync for {companyId} as previous sync {dataSetId} is still in progress"
```
