description: "Use your auth header or API key to authenticate with Codat's APIs"
---

API keys are tokens used to control access to the API. Codat expects the API key to be included in all requests to the server, Base64 encoded within an 'Authorization' header:

```json
Authorization: Basic YOUR_ENCODED_API_KEY // Replace *YOUR_ENCODED_API_KEY* with your API key, Base64 encoded
```

:::caution Permissions
Authorization headers and API keys can only be created, viewed, copied, and deleted by Administrator or Developer users.
:::

## Managing keys in the Portal

To create, view, and delete API keys and authorization headers in the Codat Portal:

1. Click **Developers > API keys** to navigate to the [API keys](https://app.codat.io/developers/api-keys) page.
2. Copy your API key or authorization header from the relevant table column. 

## Managing keys via the API

To manage API keys by making API calls, use the following endpoints:

1. [Create API keys](https://docs.codat.io/platform-api#/operations/create-api-key)
2. [List API keys](https://docs.codat.io/platform-api#/operations/list-api-keys)
3. [Delete API keys](https://docs.codat.io/platform-api#/operations/delete-api-key)

You can only view API keys, and not the corresponding authorization headers, via the API.

## ðŸ’¡ Tips and traps

- Your first API key is created for you. Pick it up in the [Codat Portal](https://app.codat.io/developers/api-keys) to perform any subsequent API calls.
- Keep the API key secret and ensure it is not available in publicly accessible areas, such as GitHub and client-side code. 
- We recommend you insert the API key at release time, and minimize the number of people at your organization with access to them.
- The number of API keys is limited to 10. If you reached the maximum number of keys, delete an unused key first.
- It is not possible to delete the last remaining API key. To delete this key, create a new one and delete the key you no longer need.
