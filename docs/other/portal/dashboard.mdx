## The Portal

Most configuration of your Codat solution happens via the Portal, and you can do all of the above through the settings pages. You can use the navigation bar to access these sections of the Portal. Some navigation bar tabs (for example, the [Developers](/other/portal/developers) tab) are only available to specific [user roles](/other/user-management/user-roles).

Here we'll run through the structure of the Portal so you know which bits you'll be using.

### Home

#### Getting started

Quick-access some useful resources including our getting started guides for both technical and non-technical users, and learn where to find your API keys (if your user role allows you access).

#### Your products

See which products are enabled for your account. By default, Accounting API, Banking API, and Commerce API are enabled.

Clicking **Manage products** takes you to the Products page, where you can manage the products you have enabled, and enable additional products.

#### Dashboard

See real-time insights into the number of companies and the current statuses of their [data connections](/core-concepts/connections). 

The dashboard displays a chart showing the number of total created companies and the number of active companies for the current billing period (depending on your plan).

Beneath this is a breakdown of the number of connections by status. A company's connections can have the following statuses: `Linked`, `PendingAuth`, `Deauthorized`, `Unlinked`, or `No connections`. A company can have multiple connections.

You can access the list of companies by selecting the **View all companies** button.

### Products

These are product-specific pages, and vary per-product. 

For Sync for Commerce and Sync for Expenses, we include a dashboard showing the history of your sync operations.

For our Accounting, Banking, and Commerce APIs, we include some product-specific getting started resources, and relevant settings.

### Companies

You can create and view companies and their data. [See more about managing companies in the Portal](/other/portal/companies)

### Monitor

See usage data, including raised webhooks, on-premise connector data, and auth flow conversion stats.

### Settings

This is where the bulk of your configuration occurs. There are 4 main settings areas:

- Auth flow - Settings relating to your authorization flow, whether your using embedded & hosted link, or your own solution
- Webhooks - Create webhook rules and email notifications
- Integrations - Enable and configure integrations, and manage the data you're retrieve from them
- Organization - [Invite users](/other/user-management/adding-users) and manage their roles, [manage your plan](/introduction/create-account) and see your billable usage, and enable products

### Developers

Manage your API keys, and see developer-specific resources.
