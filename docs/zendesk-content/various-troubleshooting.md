## Duplicate data created in accounting platform

Codat does not currently provide endpoints to delete data within an accounting platform for the majority of data types.

If duplicate data has been pushed via the Codat API, you will need to inform your customer on what data should be deleted manually from within their accounting platform.

Some accounting platforms do not allow deletion, in these cases you should advise them to Void the data instead.
