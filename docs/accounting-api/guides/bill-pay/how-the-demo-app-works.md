Now you're ready to explore the functionality of the bill pay demo app in more depth. The user flow diagrams describes the app's functionality at a high level, while the API requests document the flow of data between the app and Codat's Accounting API.

## Connect the demo app to QuickBooks Online

### Understand the authorization process

Using the demo app and Hosted Link, create a company and then authorize access to your sandbox data in QuickBooks Online. For a seamless user experience, we've customized the Hosted Link flow to use the same branding and colors as the demo app UI.

1. From the **Bill Pay** start screen, click **Get Started**.
2. Follow the instructions to:
   1. Create a company in Codat.
   2. Connect to **Intuit QuickBooks Sandbox** in the Hosted Link flow. This creates a data connection to QuickBooks Online.
   3. Authorize the demo app to access data from your sandbox QuickBooks Online company.
   4. When you've completed the Hosted Link flow, click **Launch Bills Portal** to open the demo app. Behind the scenes, the demo app redirects you to the redirect URL.

### API call: Fetch Bills

When launched, the demo app [retrives a list of all bills](/accounting-api#/operations/list-bills) from your sandbox QuickBooks Online company, in descending order of issue date.

Here is an example request:

```http title="List bills"
GET https://api.codat.io/companies/<COMPANY_ID>/data/bills?page=1&pageSize=100&orderBy=-issueDate
```

:::info View unpaid bills query
When the **View unpaid bills only toggle** is selected in the UI, the `&query=status=Open` query is appended to the request URL as a [Codat query string](/using-the-api/querying). This returns only unpaid bills.
:::

### API call: Fetch accounts

The demo app [fetches the company's latest accounts](/accounting-api#/operations/list-accounts) (banking accounts only). Here is an example request:

```http title="Pull accounts"
GET https://codat.io/companies/<COMPANY_ID>/data/accounts
```

```json title="Example response (200)"
{
    "results": [
      {
        "id": "84",
        "name": "Accounts Receivable (A/R)",
        "fullyQualifiedCategory": "Asset.Accounts Receivable.AccountsReceivable",
        "fullyQualifiedName": "Asset.Accounts Receivable.AccountsReceivable.Accounts Receivable (A/R)",
        "currency": "USD",
        "currentBalance": 5281.52,
        "type": "Asset",
        "status": "Active",
        "isBankAccount": false,

        "validDatatypeLinks": [],
        "metadata": {
          "isDeleted": false
        }
      },
      #...
     ],
        "metadata": {
          "isDeleted": false
        }
      }
    ],
    "pageNumber": 1,
    "pageSize": 100,
    "totalResults": 90,
    "_links": {
      "current": {
        "href": "/companies/3e67a1ea-a124-4a54-a241-698169eb19fb/data/accounts?page=1"
      },
      "self": {
        "href": "/companies/3e67a1ea-a124-4a54-a241-698169eb19fb/data/accounts"
      }
    }
  }
```

These accounts are displayed in the **Reference** column of the bills table.

## Pay a bill

:::note User flow for paying a bill

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant user as User
    participant backend as Demo App 
    participant codat as Codat API    
              
    user ->> backend: Selects a bill to pay
    backend ->> user: Bill payment dialog
    user ->> backend: Selects account to assign bill payment to
    user ->> backend: Pays bill & submits bill payment

    backend ->> codat: Creates Bill payment
    codat -->> backend: Push operation
    Note over codat,backend: Polls the push operation endpoint
    loop status != success
        backend ->> codat: Get push operation
        codat ->> backend: Push operation status
    end
    backend ->> backend: Update bill status
    backend ->> user: Bill shown as paid
    
```

:::

The bill remains in a `pending` status during the loop process.

When selecting an account in the **Bill Payment** dialog, the **Account name** dropdown only displays bank accounts in the same currency as the bill. The account type is determined using a query parameter for `isBankAccount=true`. 

The Bill payment will be assigned to the selected account in your sandbox QuickBooks Online company.

### API call: Post a Bill payment to the accounting platform

When you pay a bill, the demo app [creates a Bill payment](/accounting-api#/operations/create-bill-payment) in QuickBooks Online for the total amount due. This process reconciles the payment against the outstanding bill.

Here is an example request:

```http title="Create Bill payment"
POST https://api.codat.io/companies/<COMPANY_ID>/connections/<CONNECTION_ID>/push/billPayments
```

```json title="Example request body"
{
    "supplierRef": {
        "id": "<SUPPLIER_ID>" // ID of the supplier to reconcile payment against
    },
    "accountRef": {
        "id" : "<ACCOUNT_ID>" // ID of the bank account for the payment
    },
    "totalAmount": 2400.00,
    "date": "<ISO_TIMESTAMP>", // date and time of payment
    "currency": "USD",
    "lines": [
      {
        "amount": 2400.00, // total amount of bill
        "links": [
          {
            "type": "Bill",
            "id": "<BILL_ID>", // separate link for each bill the bill payment should be reconciled against
            "amount": -2400.00
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
```

## ðŸ’ª Ready for more?

Try these suggestions to make the most of your experience with the demo app:

- **Access sandbox data for a different region**  
  You can set up a sandbox QuickBooks Online company that contains data for a different region, then run through the demo app guide again. For more information, see [Create and test with a sandbox company](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/develop/sandboxes/manage-your-sandboxes) in the Intuit developer documentation.

- **Expand the app's functionality**  
  Go one step further and develop other features that make the Accounts Payable process simpler for your customers. For example, you could provide the ability to pay a bill using a credit note, or create a new bill from within your application.
