Now you're ready to explore the functionality of the bill pay demo app in more depth. The user flow diagram describes the app's functionality at a high level, while the API requests document the flow of data between the app and Codat's Accounting API.

Sections:

- Connect the demo app to QuickBooks Online
- View bills
- Pay a bill



### Understand the authorization process

Using the demo app and Hosted Link, create a company and then authorize access to your sandbox data in QuickBooks Online. For a seamless user experience, we've customized the Hosted Link flow to use the same branding and colors as the demo app UI.

1. From the **Bill Pay** start screen, click **Get Started**.
2. Follow the instructions to:
   1. Create a company in Codat.
   2. Connect to **Intuit QuickBooks Sandbox** in the Hosted Link flow. This creates a data connection to QuickBooks Online.
   3. Authorize the demo app to access data from your sandbox QuickBooks Online company.
   4. When you've completed the Hosted Link flow, click **Launch Bills Portal** to open the demo app. Behind the scenes, the demo app redirects you to the redirect URL.

:::info View unpaid bills query

When the **View unpaid bills only toggle** is selected in the UI, the `&query=status=Open` query is appended to the request URL as a [Codat query string](/using-the-api/querying). This returns only unpaid bills.

### API: Pull bank accounts

At step 2 in "Make a mock payment", the demo app [retrieves the company's latest accounts](/accounting-api#/operations/list-accounts) and queries the results by account type and currency.

```

### API: Post a Bill payment to the accounting platform

When you make a mock payment, the demo app pushes a Bill payment to QuickBooks for the total amount of the bill. This reconciles the payment against the outstanding bill.

### ðŸ’ª Ready for more?

Try these suggestions to make the most of your experience with the demo app:

- **Access sandbox data for a different region**  
  You can set up a sandbox QuickBooks Online company that contains data for a different region, then run through the demo app guide again. For more information, see [Create and test with a sandbox company](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/develop/sandboxes/manage-your-sandboxes) in the Intuit developer documentation.

- **Expand the app's functionality**  
  Go one step further and develop other features that make the Accounts Payable process simpler for your customers. For example, you could provide the ability to pay a bill using a credit note, or create a new bill from within your application.
