###  Set up the QuickBooks Online Sandbox integration

Before you can try out the functionality of the demo app, you first need to set up the QuickBooks Online Sandbox integration. Here's a summary of the setup process &mdash;Â [see the documentation](/integrations/accounting/quickbooksonline/accounting-quickbooksonline-new-setup) for complete instructions.

1. Sign in to the [Intuit Developer Portal](https://developer.intuit.com/).
2. Create a QuickBooks Online app.
3. Configure your new app with the Codat *sandbox* redirect URI: `https://quickbooksonlinesandbox.codat.io/oauth2/callback`
4. In the [Codat Portal](https://app.codat.io/), add your app's secure keys to the **QuickBooks Online Sandbox** integration.
   :::caution Use your development keys
   Make sure you use your app's *development keys* when configuring the integration.
   :::
5. Enable the **QuickBooks Online Sandbox** integration.

**Sandbox companies**

Your Intuit Developer account is created with a single sandbox company configured for the US. You're allowed to create additional sandbox companies for different regions. To do so, go to the [Manage sandbox companies](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/sandbox) page in the Intuit Developer Portal.

To open a sandbox company in QuickBooks Online, click the company name on the [Manage sandbox companies](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/sandbox) page. Your sandbox company opens in QuickBooks Online in a new browser tab.

###  Configure Link to use the demo app's redirect URL

1. In the Codat Portal, go to **Settings > Redirects** to view the [Redirects](https://app.codat.io/settings/redirects) page.
2. Enter the redirect URL in the **URL** field:
   ```http
   https://{your-domain}/connection-successful   
   ```
   For `{your-domain}`, enter the value that corresponds with your installation method.
   - Use `demo-bill-pay.vercel.app` if you're using our [hosted demo app](#run-the-hosted-demo-app).
   - Use `localhost:3000` if you plan to clone the repository and [run the demo app on your local machine](#install-and-run-the-demo-app-locally).

###  Check your data type settings

In your [data type settings](https://app.codat.io/settings/data-types), check the data types required by the demo app are set to **Fetch on first link**. You'll need to select:

- Bill Payments
- Bills
- Company

###  Run the hosted demo app

2. Open https://demo-bill-pay.vercel.app/ in a new browser tab. The **Bill Pay** app start screen is displayed:

2. Install the dependencies by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. In the root directory, create a `.env` file containing your Codat authorization header as an environment variable:

   ```
   CODAT_AUTH_HEADER="{your-auth-header}"
   ```
   You can find your authorization header in the Codat Portal. Go to **Developers > API keys**, then copy your authorization header from the relevant column.

4. Run the app: (??? Add tabs for Rider and Visual Studio)

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
