###  Set up the QuickBooks Online Sandbox integration

Before you can use the bill pay demo app, you first need to set up the QuickBooks Online Sandbox integration.

:::info Why QuickBooks Online?

We've chosen QuickBooks Online because it provides access to sandbox accounts payable data, like bills and bill payments, and also offers free trial accounts. You could use the demo app with a different Codat integration, if you prefer.

:::

1. Sign up or sign in to the [Intuit Developer Portal](https://developer.intuit.com/).
2. Create a QuickBooks Online app.
3. Configure your new app with the Codat *sandbox* redirect URI: `https://quickbooksonlinesandbox.codat.io/oauth2/callback`
4. In the [Codat Portal](https://app.codat.io/), add your app's secure keys to the **QuickBooks Online Sandbox** integration.
   :::caution Use your development keys
   Make sure you use your app's *development keys* when configuring the sandbox integration.
   :::
5. Enable the **QuickBooks Online Sandbox** integration.

For full instructions, see [Set up the QuickBooks Online integration](/integrations/accounting/quickbooksonline/accounting-quickbooksonline-new-setup).

Your QuickBooks Online account gives you access to a US sandbox company for testing purposes. You can open this company and take a look at some bills, bill payments, and other relevant sandbox data. You'll access some of this data later in this guide.

###  Configure Link to use the demo app's redirect URL

1. In the Codat Portal, go to **Settings > Redirects** to view the [Redirects](https://app.codat.io/settings/redirects) page.
2. Enter the redirect URL in the **URL** field:
   ```http
   https://{your-domain}/connection-successful   
   ```
   For `{your-domain}`, enter the value that corresponds with your installation method.
   - Use `demo-bill-pay.vercel.app` if you're using our [hosted demo app](#run-the-hosted-demo-app).
   - Use `localhost:3000` if you plan to clone the repository and [run the demo app on your local machine](#install-and-run-the-demo-app-locally).

###  Run the hosted demo app

If you want to quickly see the functionality of the demo app, you can run it on our Vercel instance in a few minutes. To get a deep dive into the code, we recommend you install and run the app on your local machine (see the next section).

1. Go to the [demo-bill-pay](https://github.com/codatio/demo-bill-pay) repository on GitHub.
2. Open https://demo-bill-pay.vercel.app/ in a new browser tab. The **Bill Pay** start screen is displayed:

   ![bill-pay_app-start-screen](/img/use-cases/bill-pay/bill-pay_app-start-screen-get-started.png)

3. Click **Get Started** to start the authorization flow.


###  Install and run the demo app locally

To run the demo app on your local machine, you'll need to have `npm` version 16.9.0 installed.

1. Clone the [demo-bill-pay](https://github.com/codatio/demo-bill-pay) GitHub repository to your local machine.

2. Install the dependencies by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. In the root directory, create a `.env` file containing your Codat authorization header as an environment variable:

   ```
   CODAT_AUTH_HEADER="{your-auth-header}"
   ```
   You can find your authorization header in the Codat Portal. Go to **Developers > API keys**, then copy your authorization header from the relevant column.

4. Run the app:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) to view the app start screen.
6. Click **Get Started** to start the authorization flow.

### Recap

You've now configured Codat and run the bill pay demo app, either locally or using our hosted version.
