### ðŸš€ In this section, you will:

- Learn what information is available in the bill pay demo app UI
- Make a mock payment against a bill, learning how the data is represented in Codat
- Check that your payment was reconciled as expected in your QuickBooks Online sandbox company
- Review the push history in the Codat Portal

Blue expandable boxes highlight the underlying API requests the app makes to the Codat API. They also highlight additional requests your own solution could make to provide richer functionality.

## New section? Authorize access to accounting data using Hosted Link

See Link in action

After running the demo app, you'll use [Hosted Link](/auth-flow/authorize-hosted-link) to create a company in Codat and authorize access to your QuickBooks Online sandbox company. This lets you see the kind of authorization flow you might build into your own bill pay solution. 

An SMB user would do this in a production scenario.

1. From the Bill Pay app start screen, click **Get Started**.

   ![bill-pay_app-start-screen](/img/use-cases/bill-pay/bill-pay_app-start-screen-get-started.png)

2. Follow the instructions in the Link UI to:
   - Create a company.
   - Authorize the bill pay demo app to access required data from your QuickBooks Online sandbox company. 
   - Launch the bill pay demo app UI.

:::tip Which integration should I choose?

In this guide, we're connecting to a QuickBooks Online sandbox company. If you're following along, select the **Intuit QuickBooks Sandbox** tile when prompted to select your accounting software.

:::

If the connection to your QuickBooks Online sandbox company was successful, you're redirected to the URL you specified in the Codat Portal earlier. Behind the scenes, the demo app created a data connection to QuickBooks Online.

*Technical box:*
When the app loads, it makes a request to the Get Bills endpoint to retieve all paid and unpaid bills from your QBO Sandbox account. (Pulls accounts payable)
Also calls the GET accounts endpoint to retrieve the bank accounts for mapping when you pay a bill.

companies/{companyId}/data/accounts

Does Not call bankAccounts endpoint. Your own app could include functionality for creating an account, if one does not already exist.

### Bill pay demo app UI

When you launch the demo app, you'll see a table of all paid and unpaid bills pulled from your QuickBooks Online sandbox company, ordered by issue date. 

![Bill pay demo app UI](/img/use-cases/bill-pay/bill-pay_demo-bill-interface.png "The Bill pay demo app UI.")

For each unpaid bill, you can view the issue date, the supplier of the goods or services received, the reference number, and the amount due.

Select the **View unpaid bills only** toggle to filter the table.

To access additional information for an unpaid bill, click **View** to display the **Invoice** dialog:

![bill-pay_invoice-detail-dialog](/img/use-cases/bill-pay/bill-pay_invoice-detail-dialog.png "The Invoice dialog shows additional information about an unpaid bill.")

This contains the following additional information:

- The Bill number, currency, and due date.
- The individual line items, if contained on the original bill.
- The account name in the accounting platform. [???]

Next, you can click **Pay Bill** to make a mock payment against the bill.

### Make a mock payment

The demo app provides functionality for making mock payments against bills. When you "pay" a bill, the app automatically pushes a bill payment to the accounting platform &mdash;Â in this case, QuickBooks Online &mdash;Â where it's reconciled against the source bill, which is marked as *paid*.

To make a mock payment:

1. Click **View** next to an unpaid bill, then click **Pay Bill**.

2. Choose an account from the **Account name** dropdown. This is the "mapping account" in your QuickBooks Online sandbox company &mdash;  the account the payment should be reconciled to.

   Only bank accounts in the same currency as the bill are shown. (Add technical box - the app calls the get bank accounts endoint using query parameters for account type and currency.)

3. Click **Pay Bill** to pay the total amount. You don't need to enter any card details.

technical box:

When you make a mock payment, the demo app pushes a Bill payment to QuickBooks for the total amount of the bill. This reconciles the payment against the outstanding bill.
(API: Post a Bill payment to the accounting platform)

### Check payment reconciliation in QuickBooks

To help you understand the process, check that payment reconciliation happened as expected in QuickBooks Online.

1. Open your Sandbox company in QuickBooks Online.. 
2. In the sidebar, select **Get paid & pay**.
3. Check the status of the bill you paid:
   1. Select **Bills**, then select the **Paid** tab.
   2. Select the bill and check the payment status is **Paid**.
   
   ![bill-pay_bill-status-paid](/img/use-cases/bill-pay/bill-pay_qbo-sandbox-company-bill-status-of-paid.png "A bill in QBO with a status of PAID.")

4. Check which bank account the payment was reconciled to:
   1. Go back to **Bills > paid**.
   2. In the **Action** column, select **Show payments** to reveal the payment row.
   3. Click **View details** to open the bill payment object.
   4. Check the **Bank/Credit account** dropdown contains the account you chose to map your mock payment to.

3. Select **Data > Push history**.
4. Review the push history to check the recent  `billPayments` push operation completed successfully.

### Recap

You tried out the demo app by viewing bills and making mock payments. By doing so, you learned the underlying API calls made to the Codat API. Finally, you checked the source data in QuickBooks Online to understand the account reconciliation process.
