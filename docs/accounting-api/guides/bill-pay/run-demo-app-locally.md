:::info Why QuickBooks Online?
We've chosen QuickBooks Online for this demo guide because it provides easy access to sandbox data through a free trial account. You can use the demo app with a different integration that supports pushing Bill payments, such as Codat sandbox, if you prefer.
:::

1. Sign up or sign in to the [Intuit Developer Portal](https://developer.intuit.com/).
2. Create a QuickBooks Online app.
3. Configure your new app with the Codat *sandbox* redirect URI: `https://quickbooksonlinesandbox.codat.io/oauth2/callback`
4. In the [Codat Portal](https://app.codat.io/), add your app's secure keys to the **QuickBooks Online Sandbox** integration.

   :::caution Use your development keys
   Make sure you use your app's *development keys* when configuring the sandbox integration.   
   :::

5. Enable the **QuickBooks Online Sandbox** integration.
