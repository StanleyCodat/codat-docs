### ðŸš€ In this section, you will...
* Create your Codat account
* Configure webhooks
* Set up your local environment
* Run the demo app

### <input type="checkbox" unchecked/> Create a Codat account 

We provide a [free account](https://signup.codat.io/) that lets you explore and test our APIs and other products. It also comes equipped with a sample company. When you start working on your own invoice financing solution, you may want to explore our other [plans](https://www.codat.io/plans/).

Your new account already has the Accounting API product, the Codat Sandbox integration, and the relevant data types enabled to get you started quicker.

### <input type="checkbox" unchecked /> Update your auth flow settings

In the **Settings > Auth Flow > Link** [settings](https://app.codat.io/settings/link-settings/data-connections), check that the _Sanbox integrations_ and _Accounting_ integration category are enabled, and disable _Commerce_ and _Banking_ integration categories. 

### <input type="checkbox" unchecked /> Listen for webhooks

The app uses several webhooks to track the completion of an accounting data connection and the completion of data sync for the invoice and customer data types.

We will use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) in the app to listen for Codat's webhooks. 

<Tabs>
   <TabItem value="win" label="Windows OS">  

   In Windows PowerShell, run the following commands:

   ```bash
   choco install ngrok
   ngrok http 7278
   ```
   
   This will install ngrok using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) and run it at port 7278. 
   
   Copy the **forwarding address** - this will be the `<server-url>` for the webhooks.

   </TabItem>

   <TabItem value="mac" label="Mac OS">

   In the terminal, run the following commands:
   
   ```bash
   brew install ngrok
   ngrok http 7278
   ```  
   This will install ngrok using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and run it at port 7278. 
   
   Copy the **forwarding address** - this will be the `<server-url>` for the webhooks.

   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### <input type="checkbox" unchecked /> Configure Codat webhooks

In the **Monitor > Alerts > [Alerting rules](https://app.codat.io/monitor/rules)** section of the Codat Portal, create two rules for all companies, one for each webhook we will use:

   |  Rule type                                  | Webhook notification URL                                    |
   |---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Company Data Connection status has changed  | ```<server-url>/webhooks/codat/data-connection-status```       |
   | Data sync completed                         | ```<server-url>/webhooks/codat/datatype-sync-complete```       |

Click **Create rule** to open the new rule creation window. Select the rule type, apply it to all companies, and assign it a webhook URL. Make sure to replace the `<server-url>` with your forwarding address.

### <input type="checkbox" unchecked /> Clone the code

Clone our demo repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/codatio/demo-invoice-finance) to download the underwriting demo app. 

The main file directory for the demo app is `Codat.Demos.InvoiceFinancing.Api`. Key logic components of the app are located in `Controllers`, `Orchestrator`, and `Services` folders.

Note that the other directory in the repository, `Codat.Demos.InvoiceFinancing.Api.Tests`, contains a series of unit tests for the demo app and is not needed for you to run the demo project. 

```sh title="Codat.Demos.InvoiceFinancing.Api directory"
   â”œâ”€â”€BindingModule.cs
   â”œâ”€â”€Codat.Demos.InvoiceFinancing.Api.csproj
   â”œâ”€â”€Program.cs

```
### <input type="checkbox" unchecked/> Set your API key

In the [Developers](https://app.codat.io/developers/api-keys) section of the Codat Portal, copy your API key from the **API key** column **(not the auth header)**. You can click **Create another API key** if one wasn't automatically generated for you. In the `Codat.Demos.InvoiceFinancing.Api` directory, edit the `appsettings.json` file and enter the API key you just copied as the `CodatApiKey`.

### <input type="checkbox" unchecked/> Run the app

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="cmd" label="Command line">

Run the following command in the root directory `Codat.Demos.InvoiceFinancing.Api`:

```sh
dotnet run --launch-profile http
```
Once running, open the Swagger page in your web browser: `http://localhost:7278/swagger/index.html` You will use it to call the demo's endpoints.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="rider" label="Rider">

Make sure the `http` profile is set and press "Run". The IDE will automatically open [Swagger](http://localhost:7278/swagger/index.html) in a new tab of your browser. You will use it to call the demo's endpoints.

<TabItem value="vs" label="Visual studio">

Ensure the `http` profile is set and press the "Play" icon. The IDE will automatically open [Swagger](http://localhost:7278/swagger/index.html) in a new tab of your browser. You will use it to call the demo's endpoints.
