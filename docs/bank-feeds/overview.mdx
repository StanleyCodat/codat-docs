## How does it work?

![Bank Feeds API](/img/old/fd21af0-codat_whitepaper_accounting-automation_diagram_B.png)

### [Create source accounts](/bank-feeds/create-account)
A bank feed is a connection between a _source bank account_ and a _target bank account_ in a supported accounting package. 

First, you should create a 'source account' in Codat that serves as replica of an actual financial account, savings account or credit card. This account can later be mapped to a target account in your customers' accounting software.

### [Connect and map accounts](/bank-feeds/mapping)
The method of connecting and mapping this source account to your target account varies depending on the accounting package your customer is using. Typically there are three methods of mapping the source account to a target account:

- **API mapping:** integrate the mapping journey directly into your application for a seamless user experience.
- **Codat UI mapping:** if you prefer a quicker setup, you can utilize Codat's provided user interface for mapping.
- **Accounting platform mapping:** for some accounting softwares, the mapping process must be conducted within the software itself.

:::note Platform requirements

The setup process and platform registration requirements vary for each Bank Feeds API integration. For detailed instructions, refer to the documentation for each integration.
:::

### [Push transactions](/bank-feeds/pushing-transactions)
Once the SMB user has completed the authorization and account mapping process, you are set to begin pushing transactions into the target bank account on the accounting platform.
