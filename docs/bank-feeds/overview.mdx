The [Bank Feeds API](/bank-feeds-api#/) empowers developers to automate the integration of bank transactions into accounting software for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). This removes the cumbersome step of manual uploads each month, giving businesses a more timely view of their finances. A recent survey revealed that [71% of Xero partners](https://www.xero.com/blog/2019/01/new-bank-feeds-process/) identify bank feeds and reconciliation as their most valued features.

By leveraging this API, you can meet this demand; it offers compatibility with multiple popular accounting platforms through a standardized set of endpoints. 

The end result is a simplified financial management process for SMBs, which not only streamlines their accounting but it also elevates their overall experience with your application.

## How it works

![Bank Feeds API](/img/old/fd21af0-codat_whitepaper_accounting-automation_diagram_B.png)

### [Creating source accounts](/bank-feeds/setup)
A bank feed is a connection between a _source bank account_ — and a _target bank account_ in a supported accounting package. 

To begin with, you should create a 'source account' in Codat, this serves as replica of an actual financial account, savings account, or credit card, in Codat. This account can later be mapped to a target account in your customers accounting software.

### [Connecting and mapping accounts](/bank-feeds/mapping)
The method of connecting and mapping this source account to your target account varies depending on the accounting package your customer is using, typically there are three methods of mapping the source account to a target account:
- **API Mapping:** Integrate the mapping journey directly into your application for a seamless user experience.
- **Codat UI Mapping:** If you prefer a quicker setup, you can utilize Codat's provided user interface for mapping.
- **Accounting Platform Mapping:** For some accounting softwares, the mapping process must be conducted within the software itself.

:::note Platform requirements

The setup process and platform registration requirements vary for each Bank Feeds integration. For detailed instructions, refer to the documentation for each integration.
:::

### [Pushing transactions](/bank-feeds/pushing-transactions)
Once the SMB user has completed the authorization and account mapping process, you are set to begin pushing transactions into the target bank account on the accounting platform.
