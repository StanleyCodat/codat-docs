Once you have created the source account and other key elements of Codat's infrastructure, provide your user with a UI so they can select the target accounts in their accounting platform. This will tell us where exactly to create bank transactions.

Depending on your customer's accounting software, there are three methods you can use to provide the mapping UI:

- **API mapping:** integrate the mapping journey into your application for a seamless user experience.
- **Codat UI mapping:** utilize Codat's provided mapping user interface for a quicker start.
- **Accounting platform mapping:** use the platform's own mapping interface when the process must be conducted within the software itself.

<IntegrationsList filter={['QuickBooks Online']} />

For Bank Feeds in QuickBooks Online, the account mapping is conducted within the QuickBooks platform itself. Codat produces a secure username and password against a dataConnection which can be entered into QuickBooks, facilitating the account and transaction verification process.

There are two ways you can share credentials with a Company - either via a hosted and customizable Codat credentials page, or alternatively through the generate-credentials endpoint.
