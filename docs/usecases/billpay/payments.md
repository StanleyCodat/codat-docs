When the user has completed their mapping and makes a payment from your application, this can then be reconciled back to the users accounting platform. 
A bill payment in Codat usually represents an allocation of money within any customer accounts payable account. This includes, but is not strictly limited to:

- A payment made against a bill â€” for example, a credit card payment, cheque payment, or cash payment.
- An allocation of a supplier's credit note to a bill or perhaps a refund.
- A bill payment made directly to an accounts payable account. This could be an overpayment or a prepayment, or a refund of a payment made directly to an accounts payable account.

Depending on the bill payments which are allowed by the underlying accounting package, some of these types may be combined.

#### Paying a bill with a billPayment
If the scenario is a company making a payment to pay off a bill in full, then it should have the following properties:
- A `totalAmount` indicating the amount of the bill that was paid. This is **always positive**. 
- A lines array containing one element with the following properties:
  - An amount equal to the `totalAmount` above. 
  - A links array containing one element with the following properties:
    - A `type` indicating the type of link, in this case a Bill. 
    - An `id` containing the ID of the bill that was paid. 
    - An `amount` of **-**totalAmount (negative `totalAmount`), indicating that the entirety of the paid amount is allocated to the bill.
