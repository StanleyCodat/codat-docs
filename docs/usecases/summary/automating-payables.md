Engage Codat and automate your customers' accounts payable processes by reflecting outstanding and paid bills and invoices from business software spend and suppliers in their accounting platforms.

### How Codat can help

We can support B2B payment and invoicing software companies, payment providers, and vertical SaaS companies in their activity by leveraging our [Accounting API](/accounting-api/overview) product. 

It enables businesses to track and manage their spend, typically including the whole purchasing flow from the creation of the PO through to a bill payment.

#### Accounting API

We have done the heavy lifting for you by building integrations with a standardized data model to the accounting platforms your customers already use. This gives you access to real-time data that you can pull, create, or update to support your use case.

For automating payables, the Accounting API provides you and your customers with these benefits:

- Increase spend visibility and track spend forecasts against budgets
- Reduce time and effort by automating the PO matching process
- Perform faster payments, building better relationships with suppliers
- Improve compliance without unnecessary bureaucracy
- Simplify reconciliation by marking bills as paid when the purchase is completed
