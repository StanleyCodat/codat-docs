### Billing

When using our start-up plan, you do not pay any monthly commitment fees. Instead, you will be charged for **each active company**. 

:::tip Active companies

Active companies represent your customer connections where you have successfully pulled or pushed data within your billing period. The first time you pull or push data for a company with and active connection in a given billing period, it will count as an active company.

This excludes *Codat Sandbox* and *QuickBooks Online Sandbox*.
:::

You can use our Billing [dashboard](https://app.codat.io/settings/billing/usage) to track your usage and stay in control of your bills.
