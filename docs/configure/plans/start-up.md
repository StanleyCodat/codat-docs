:::danger Legacy plan

This page contains details of our legacy Start-up plan that is not available for new customers. Refer to our [Plans](/configure/create-account) page for the most up-to-date options.


:::

You can get started with Codat with usage-based billing at Â£25/$30 per month per Active Connected Company (active = data pushed or pulled in a given billing period).

### Features

- Access our standardized integrations and products
- No monthly commitment
- Unlimited companies
- Unlimited seats

### Billing

When using our start-up plan, you do not pay any monthly commitment fees. Instead, you will be charged for **each active company**. 

:::tip Active companies

Active companies represent your customer connections where you have successfully pulled or pushed data within your billing period. The first time you pull or push data for a company with an active connection in a given billing period, it will count as an active company.


Active companies that are connected only to Codat Sandbox or QuickBooks Online Sandbox are excluded from billing.
:::

You can use our Billing [dashboard](https://app.codat.io/settings/billing/usage) to track your usage and stay in control of your bills. 

#### Detailed usage view

If you are signed up to Codat's start-up plan, you can view detailed usage and billing information, including monetary amounts associated with your specific experience, by navigating to **Settings > Organization settings > Billing** in the [Codat Portal](https://app.codat.io/settings/billing). 
The **Plans** tab provides you with a summary view of your current [plan](https://www.codat.io/plans/), a list of your enabled products, and a preliminary billing total for the current billing period based on your usage to date. 

The **Usage** tab shows the active companies associated with your account and their impact on your expected billing totals. You can examine the companies that were active in the selected billing period, view this data in a graph form, and check how the number of active companies influences the amount of your predicted charge. You can also compare your usage and cost across periods by selecting a different **Billing range**.

### Test client creation

When you upgrade to our start-up plan, we clone details from your existing client to automatically create a test instance for you. You can use it to test your solution before go-live or validate that your live solution is performing as expected. [Learn more](/using-the-api/testing) about client cloning, possible testing approaches, and our recommendations.

To see the new client once it's been created, you will need to reauthenticate. Log out and log back in if you are using Portal, or get a new token if you are using our APIs.

:::info Active company limit

Test clients are limited to 50 active connected companies and are not included in the billing.
