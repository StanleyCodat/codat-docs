Link settings allow you to white-label Hosted and Embedded Link to suit your brand, and configure the authorization process based on your data needs. You can customize Link settings in the [Codat Portal](https://app.codat.io) in [**Settings > Auth flow > Link**](https://app.codat.io/settings/link-settings) for a variety of uses, as described further.

## Data connections

**Sandbox integrations**

Allow sandbox or test integrations to appear in the link flow. Some integrations split their production and sandbox data into separate environments, each with its own unique credentials.

Let's take QuickBooks Online as an example. Enabling this feature would show options for _QuickBooks Online_ and _QuickBooks Online Sandbox_ in the link flow. This also includes the Codat Sandbox integrations.

:::note Sandbox integrations in the auth flow

Sandbox integrations appear in the auth flow by default. You can override this behavior by appending the `link.showSandboxIntegrations` query parameter to the Link URL with a value of "true" or "false".
:::

**Integration categories**

Select which types of integrations (accounting, banking, or commerce) you'd like customers to connect. You can make each integration type optional if you want your customers to be able to skip sharing it.

Before enabling these, you need to [set up one or more integrations](/core-concepts/integrations) for each integration type. Otherwise, the Link UI will display a blank 'Select your platform' page when companies attempt to link their accounting, banking, or commerce data.

For the Business documents integration type, you need to enable it in **Settings > Integrations > Other integrations**. You can also let your users know what files they should upload for each integration category by providing a description under **File upload**.

:::tip Banking integrations in the auth flow

You should only enable one of the banking integrations at a time. This ensures optimal use of Hosted or Embedded Link, as each banking integration is [represented differently](/integrations/banking/overview#banking-integrations-in-the-authorization-flow) in the auth flow.
:::

**Retries**  
Allow your customers to restart the linking process for accounting platforms in case their first connection attempt fails. The "Try again" button will appear on the error page.

_Note_: The possibility to restart the linking process for commerce and banking platforms is available by default.

## Onboarding

**Mobile support warning**  
Let your users know that some integrations are not optimized or will not connect via mobile when accessing the connection journey on mobile.

**Powered by Codat**  
Toggle whether the _Powered by Codat_ logo is shown on your authorization flow. This toggle is always on when using our free plan.

**Landing page**  
If enabled, an extra page will appear at the start of Link. The page's content is customizable, which is an excellent opportunity to explain the value of linking. You can customize the header and the body of the message.

**Left panel**  
Specify the messaging that appears on the left panel throughout the Link flow. This is an opportunity to clarify what the user is about to do. You can customize the header and the body of the message.

**Data access consent**  
This is a mandatory field where you need to specify the message you want to display to companies when sharing data with you.

Optionally, you can add a message and a URL for terms and conditions you'd like your clients to read before they share their data with you.

**Data type information**  
List the data you're going to collect for each of the integration categories (accounting, banking, or commerce). This is displayed in the auth flow to inform the user which data types Codat will use after linking the data source. 

:::tip Data types with Plaid

If you enabled Plaid as your banking integration, the data type information from this section will not be shown in Link. This is because Plaid provides their own list of data types within their auth flow.

:::

**Exit confirmation dialog**  
Customize the message your customers see if they cancel before completing the linking process.

**Invite company page**  
Once you provide your customers with a Link URL, they reach a page where they provide their company name and start the linking process. You can customize the header and the body of the message on that page.

## Client-level information

**Help and support**  
Customize your help and support messages that are displayed throughout the Link flow.

**Data security**  
Provide a link to your data security policy.

**Terms and conditions content**  
Specify the message you'd like to display to companies if you have specific terms and conditions you'd like them to view before linking.
