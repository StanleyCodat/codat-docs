:::caution Early access

The currently available Embedded Link is a beta, and a new version is coming next month. If you run into issues, please [contact support](mailto:support@codat.io). 

This next version will solve a number of issues with this initial version, and work with non-React JS apps.

If you have any feedback, please [get in touch](mailto:embedded-link@codat.io)! You can also [request features and suggest improvements](https://portal.productboard.com/codat/12-public-devex-roadmap/c/485-embed-a-pre-built-auth-flow-in-your-website-or-app) in our roadmap!
:::

Use the Embedded Link solution to benefit from a pre-built code component that melds best practices together with our extensive experience in building authorization flows, while seamlessly embedding it into your webpage or front-end application.

Codat's Embedded Link is a React component that neatly sits in your front-end code, and can be deployed in a matter of minutes.

We built Embedded Link to be flexible so that you can integrate and initialize it in any way you want, and provide the user with a native feel of your authorization journey.

## Resources

- Grab our component library on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@codat/link-sdk)
- View [a sample project](https://github.com/codatio/sample-project-link-sdk) adding Link to a default project

## Prerequisites

You should use React 18 when embedding the Link component into your webpage or application. However, the component is also backwards compatible with React 17.

## Getting started

Codat's Embedded Link component is published to <a className="external" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@codat/link-sdk" target="_blank">npm</a> as a React library.

You can install this library using npm:

```
npm i @codat/link-sdk
```

After installing the library, add it to your project:

```
import { CodatLink } from '@codat/link-sdk';
import '@codat/link-sdk/index.css';
```

## Embedding the Link application

The component requires a `companyId` parameter to open Link for a specific company. To obtain the `companyId`, first [create a Codat company](/using-the-api/managing-companies) for your customer. We recommend doing that at the same time as your SMB customer signs up within your app.

From the response to company creation, retain the `companyId` parameter. Then, initialize the Codat Link component in your app:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="react" label="React">

```js
<CodatLink
  companyId="0f19b01c-3d1f-4dbf-80b6-37ab241bea2e"
  onConnection={(id) => alert("Success: Connection " + id + " established")} // Called each time a connection is established
  onFinish={() => alert("Finished")} // Called when the flow is completed
  onClose={() => alert("Closed")} // Called when the user clicks 'X' or completes the whole flow
  onError={(err) => alert("Error: " + err)} // Called when an error is reached
/>
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="next" label="Next.js">

```js
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'; // Use dynamic imports instead for NextJS
import '@codat/link-sdk/index.css';
  
const CodatLink = dynamic(
  () => import('@codat/link-sdk').then((mod) => mod.CodatLink),
  { ssr: false }
);

const AuthFlow = ({ id }) => {
  return (
    <CodatLink
      companyId="0f19b01c-3d1f-4dbf-80b6-37ab241bea2e"
      onConnection={(id) => alert("Success: Connection " + id + " established")} // Called each time a connection is established
      onFinish={() => alert("Finished")} // Called when the flow is completed
      onError={() => alert("error")}
      onClose={() => alert("on close")}
    />
  );
};
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Pitfalls

- Disable `React.StrictMode` in your project.
- **React versions** - Component is built using React 18, but is backwards compatible with React 17.
- **Mobile compatibility** - The component is not optimized for use on mobile devices.
- **Using NextJS** - Use dynamic imports (as per the NextJS code snippet above). As above, React.StrictMode should still be disabled.
