## Client libraries

Codat offers official API libraries for different programming languages, which are regularly updated for breaking and non-breaking API changes. These client libraries are generated from our [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/codatio/oas).

- [TypeScript](https://github.com/codatio/client-sdk-typescript)
- [Python](https://github.com/codatio/client-sdk-python)
- [Go](https://github.com/codatio/client-sdk-go)
- COMING SOON! [C#](https://github.com/codatio/client-sdk-csharp)

## Community libraries

Codat's awesome community has self-published a number of libraries themselves!

**Community libraries are not officially supported by Codat.** Codat cannot provide assistance with using these libraries or guarantee that they will be kept up-to-date with the latest changes, feature additions, and deprecations.

If you built your own library, please reach out to our [developer experience team](mailto:developer-experience@codat.io) to add it to this list! The best way to create your own library is by using the Codat [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/codatio/oas).
