When you're finished testing your Codat solution, you can upgrade to either of our Start-up or Enterprise plans &mdash; see <a className="external" href="https://www.codat.io/plans/" target="_blank">Plans</a> for details.

### Free account limitations

The free account provides a trial of Codat that lasts for 365 days. When signed up to a free account, you can:

- Create up to 50 companies.
- Create unlimited connections to Sandbox data.
- Create up to five connections at a time to each of our accounting, commerce, and banking integrations.
- Schedule data syncs to refresh data daily, weekly, or monthly (but not hourly).

## Moving to a paid account

You have two options when you're ready to move to a paid account. You can:

- Pay through Stripe on our start-up plan based on your monthly usage.
- [Contact our sales team](https://www.codat.io/plans/#get-in-touch) to discuss enterprise pricing options.

If you're an Admin, you can view the available pricing plans and upgrade via Stripe by visiting <a href="https://app.codat.io/settings/billing" target="_blank">Billing</a> in the Codat Portal.

### Start-up plan billing

When using our start-up plan, you do not pay any monthly commitment fees. Instead, you will be charged for **each active company**. Active companies represent your customer connections where you have successfully pulled or pushed data within your billing period. 

You can use our Billing [dashboard](https://app.codat.io/settings/billing/usage) to track your usage and stay in control of your bills. 

:::tip Sandbox connections

Active companies that are connected **only** to Codat Sanbox or QuickBooks Online Sandbox are excluded from the billing of the Start-up plan.
