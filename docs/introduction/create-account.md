You have two options when you're ready to move to a paid plan. You can:

- Pay through Stripe on our start-up plan based on your monthly usage.
- [Contact our sales team](https://www.codat.io/plans/#get-in-touch) to discuss enterprise pricing options.

If you're an Admin, you can view the available pricing plans and upgrade via Stripe by visiting <a href="https://app.codat.io/settings/billing" target="_blank">Billing</a> in the Codat Portal.

## Start-up plan 

### Features

Everything from Free plus:
- No monthly commitment
- Unlimited companies
- Unlimited seats

### Billing

When using our start-up plan, you do not pay any monthly commitment fees. Instead, you will be charged for **each active company**. 

:::tip Active companies

Active companies represent your customer connections where you have successfully pulled or pushed data within your billing period. The first time you pull or push data for a company with and active connection in a given billing period, it will count as an active company.

This excludes *Codat Sandbox* and *QuickBooks Online Sandbox*.
:::

You can use our Billing [dashboard](https://app.codat.io/settings/billing/usage) to track your usage and stay in control of your bills. 

## Enterprise plan

### Features

Everything from Start-up plus:

- Volume-based pricing
- Implementation support

- Hourly syncing

### Billing

Our enterprise plans is much more cost effective than our start-up plan once your usage of Codat scales. [Contact our sales team](https://www.codat.io/plans/#get-in-touch) to discuss enterprise pricing options.
