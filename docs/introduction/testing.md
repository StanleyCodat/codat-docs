We recommend you test your solution before go-live or 

You may also need to validate that your live solution is performing as expected, for example, when enabling a deprecation early. 

Here are some strategies
what you need is: 

we will cover: 


* test client
* sandbox data
* Codat sandbox
* test strategy

:::info Testing without a test client

You can organize testing in your production client. Use Codat Sandbox or QuickBooks Online Sandbox - these are excluded from billing. Additionally, some integrations provide a separate set of credentials for testing, which you can use. 

:::

## Test client

We recommend creating an additional instance of Codat to use for testing purposes, so that you can perform validations and verify changes without impacting your production build and setup. 

2 different code out clients today.
and 2 sets of Api keys.

If you are on our **Free** plan, simply register for another account to create your test instance.

If you are on our **Enterprise** plan, we would have already worked with you to arrange a test client. 

If you upgrade to our **Start-up** plan, we clone details from your existing client to automatically create a test client for you.

We copy the following details and settings: 

* All users with access to the existing client
* Client settings and feature overrides
* Enabled products and deprecations
* Integration-specific settings and credentials
* Client sync settings
* Webhook rules and settings
* Auth flow settings

### Pitfalls

- Remember that the test client will have a separate set of API keys, and you may need to maintain different credentials for the integrations in the test instance. 

- To see the new client once it's been created, you will need to reauthenticate. Log out and lock back in if you are using Portal, or get a new token if you are using our APIs.

- Test clients are limited to 50 active connected companies and are not included in the billing. 

## Testing strategy

When devising a testing strategy and a testing plan for your implementation, consider covering the following approaches:

1. Back-end integration testing

   Once you complete the initial API build to Codat's endpoint, you need to ensure the integration is working as expected. We recommend performing validation using sandbox data (this can be Codat, Quickbooks Online, or Xero sandbox data). 

2. Live SMB testing

   Involve one of your real SMB customers to perform authentication via your front-end digital application flow. Then, verify that the data syncs between the relevant platform and Codat, and triggers a webhook into your system to start the data pull.

## Testing the integrations

When testing your  integrations, it is important to consider checking you can connect and authorise using a demo or sandbox account before sharing with potential customers.

Codat recommends testing throughout implementation with our Sandbox account and Xero and QuickBooks online who both offering demo/sandbox accounts with no fixed trials. Other integrations may require signing up to free trials in order to test the connection, as this trial can be time limited you may want to test towards the end of your implementation or request multiple trials.

### Codat sandbox

### Sandbox integrations

Active companies that are connected only to Codat Sandbox or QuickBooks Online Sandbox are excluded from billing, if you are using these integrations to test in your production instance. 

contains sample data generated by Codat as a tool for developer testing.

When you link to Sandbox, you are presented with different data sets to choose from. Each data set provides a different level of detail.
