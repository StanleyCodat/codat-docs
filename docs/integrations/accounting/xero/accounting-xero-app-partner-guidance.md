The process of becoming a Xero App Partner depends on your use case. Xero has two categories of App Partners:

- [Financial Services App Partners](#financial-services-app-partners), including [Lending App Partners](#lending-app-partners) and [Payments App Partners](#payments-app-partners)
- [Xero App Store Partners](#xero-app-store-partners), also known as _Ecosystem App Partners_

For guidance on what category applies to your use case, consult your Codat account team.

To avoid unnecessary delays, we recommend progressing the commercial and technical aspects of App Partnership in parallel, if possible.

:::caution App partnership is not always possible

Note that Xero App Partnership is not possible for some use cases.

## Financial Services App Partners

There are several subcategories within Financial Services; follow the guidance for your specific use case.

You are required to obtain Xero's written consent for each Financial Services use case that you implement.

## Lending App Partners

:::info Geographic restrictions for lending partners

App Partnership is currently only available to lenders operating in specific countries, including the UK, Australia, and New Zealand.

Lenders operating in the US, Canada, and Ireland are currently unable to become Xero App Partners.

:::

To become a Lending App Partner you need to:

- Implement *lending write-back* functionality within your application, as described below.
- Set up a Commercial Agreement with Xero.
- Comply with all the relevant [Xero Certification Checkpoints](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/xero-app-store/app-partner-guides/certification-checkpoints/).

### Lending write-back

Xero has one unique technical requirement for lenders: lending write-back.

The goal of the write-back is to maintain the customer's financial position in Xero at all points of the lending cycle. This is achieved by recording the loan liability, interest and/or fees, and repayments, and facilitating the reconciliation of bank accounts.

To learn about write-back in depth, see the [Xero developer documentation](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/guides/how-to-guides/general-lending-integration-guide/).

:::tip Work closely with your account team on write-back

We recommend you work closely with your Codat account team to implement lending write-back in your application. They can provide detailed guidance that is specific to the type of lending you do.
