---

Before you can go live with Xero Bank Feeds you must go through Xero’s partner certification process. To achieve Xero certification, you must comply with two different sets of technical requirement:

1) Xero’s Certification Checkpoints
•	These are documented on [Xero’s website](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/xero-app-store/app-partner-guides/certification-checkpoints/) and apply to all types of Xero app – not just Bank Feeds
•	Not all these checkpoints are relevant to Bank Feeds (guidance below)

2) Xero's Bank Feed-specific requirements
•	These are not documented on Xero’s website
• Your Codat account team can provide you with a template of Xero’s App Review form which provides details of the requirements

Codat's Bank Feeds product handles most of these requirements for you but there are a few areas where you need verify you are compliant. 

## Xero’s Certification Checkpoints

### 1. App name

**Action required: minimal**

You may not think of your bank feed as an ‘app’. This is simply Xero’s terminology for any connection to the Xero API. Your ‘app’ name is visible to end users at multiple points in the customer journey and it must reflect the go-to-market name of your company or product. It cannot include the word Xero. You can edit your app's name in the My Apps section of your Xero Developer Portal.

### 2. Branding

**Action required: minimal**

You must be compliant with Xero's guidance wherever you mention your Xero Partnership or use their brand assets. To ensure that, review Xero's [Brand Guidelines](https://developer.xero.com/static/otherfiles/xero-app-partner-brand-guidelines.pdf) and [Branding how-to-guide](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/guides/how-to-guides/branding-your-integration/).

## Xero’s Bank Feed-specific requirements

### 1. Account mapping

**Action required: none**

This checkpoint is fully handled by Codat. It is a duplicate of what is covered above - but with more Bank Feed-specific detail. 

### 2. Account containers match online banking

**Action required: some**

This is a shared responsibility between you and Codat. We will work with you to ensure your Bank Feed implementation is compliant. 
  
Xero checks:
•	If credit cards are part of the integration then the standard approach is to post all statements to a master bank account in Xero, or to have a card account in Xero for each card. 
•	Account containers match online banking

### 3. Bank name/logos/account number

**Action required: some**

This is a shared responsibility between you and Codat. We will work with you to ensure your Bank Feed implementation is compliant. 

Xero checks:
•	Is your brand correctly represented in Xero?
•	Are you setting an appropriate name for the accounts you create and is your logo showing correctly?
•	Are you setting the account number so that it displays correctly in Xero?

### 4. Scheduled refresh

**Action required: none**

This is fully handled by Codat.

### 5. Error handling

**Action required: none**

This is fully handled by Codat.

### 6. Statement line items

**Action required: some**

This is a shared responsibility between you and Codat. We will work with you to ensure your Bank Feed implementation is compliant. 

Xero checks:
•	Signage in Xero matches the signage in the banks UI (+/-)
•	Meaningful statement line detail that represents the actual transaction in the bank / app
•	Field mapping makes sense
•	Dates match

### 7. Fee line items

**Action required: none**

This is fully handled by Codat.

### 8. Disconnections flow

**Action required: none**

This is fully handled by Codat.

### 9. Missed / Rejected statements

**Action required: some**

This is a shared responsibility between you and Codat. We will work with you to ensure your Bank Feed implementation is compliant. 

Xero checks:
•	What happens when a statement gets rejected / missed
•	What do you do to make up a missed statement? (Re-added to the next queue / Dedicated call)
•	Will the user be notified if a statement gets rejected / missed?

Missed statements will be caught and prevented by Codat. If a statement is rejected, Codat communicates this to you. We will work with you to ensure you are able to reflect this appropriately to your users. 

### 10. Rate Limit Management

**Action required: none**

This is fully handled by Codat.
