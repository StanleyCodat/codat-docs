title: "Xero Scopes by Use Case"
description: "A guide to Xero Partnership certification with Codat"
---
As part of the Xero App Partner Program, [Checkpoint 7: Scopes](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/xero-app-store/app-partner-guides/certification-checkpoints/#required-for-all-integrations) requires that apps only have access to the data they require for their use case. In order to comply, you must define the scopes you need for your intended use case. During your App Review, Xero will ask you to justify your use of scopes and explain why you are accessing the related data.

We have mapped out the Xero scopes that apply to each specific Codat use case below.

Note that these scopes are required for all Codat integrations regardless of use case listed below:
* offline_access
* accounting.settings
