## Where must company data be stored?

It must be stored online. Whilst MYOB AccountRight Live gives the option to store a company data file locally, this will make it inaccessible for Codat's integration.

**See <a href="http://help.myob.com/wiki/display/ar/Put+your+company+file+online" target="_blank">here</a> for how companies can easily move their company file to the cloud if it is currently stored on their local machine.**

## How do I check whether company data is stored online?

When a company data file is correctly stored online (to enable linking with the Codat integration), the file should be visible when selecting 'Online' from the 'Open' menu within MYOB AccountRight.

## Does the integration support multiple company data files for the same linked connection?

The integration does not currently support this. This will be implemented in the future.
