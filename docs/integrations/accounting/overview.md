Codatâ€™s accounting integrations allow you to pull up-to-date accounting data from your customers' accounting software as well as push data to their software. Please see our [Accounting data model](/data-model/accounting/) for details on the types of data you can pull and push.

You can use [Codat's Sandbox integration](/integrations/accounting/sandbox/accounting-sandbox) to start exploring the data you can work with, without any set up (other than enabling the integration).

If you've got an existing integration that you'd like to migrate to Codat, we can migrate tokens for [most OAuth integrations](/get-started/migration).

## Supported accounting software

Codat's integrations are able to connect to the following accounting software. You can see more information, including set up instructions for each integration, by clicking through to the documentation at the links below.

You can also explore the data types supported by each integration in the interactive <a className="external" href="https://knowledge.codat.io/supported-features/accounting" target="_blank">Data coverage explorer</a>.
