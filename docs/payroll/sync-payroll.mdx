## Generate payroll object

Before you can record the payroll in the accounting platform, you'll need to generate a line item object for each employee for each corresponding payroll component. That means you'll likely have multiple line items for each employee.

Each line item object should have the following information:

- `description` - Employee name
- `accountRef` - The corresponding account
- `netAmount` - Net amount paid to employee
- `currency` - The currency corresponding to the amount
- `tracking` - A list of references to records for tracking

## Record payroll

In order to record payroll entries in the accounting platform, you can use the [create journal entries](/sync-for-payroll-api#/operations/create-journal-entry) endpoint to push payroll to the mapped accounts on the SMB's general ledger.

The journal entry can then be reconciled against the debit entry in the companies bankfeeds.
