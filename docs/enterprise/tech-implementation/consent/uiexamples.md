This is an example flow for a consent journey which powers a business insights dashboard.

* A user is prompted to select their accounting package
* They view the data they are sharing both in your platform and the accounting package
* Throughout the journey they are reminded of why they are sharing data and the product value
* There are links to get help should an issue arrise
* Once linked they are able to manage their connection and choose to disconnect if they wish
* They are able to reauthorize from the same place if they change their mind

The screens here are for a business insights dashboard but these points are applicable for any use case.
