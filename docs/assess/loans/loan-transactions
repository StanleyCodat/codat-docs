## Introduction to Loan transactions endpoint
Loan data is often not uniform, spread across a variety of integrations and of different types.
These loans are often hard to identify, analyse and group.
Manually going through data and identifying loans is very time consuming and repetitive. This can also introduce room for human error.

Our Loan Transactions endpoint can identify loans from a company's accounting, banking and commerce integrations. 
It can work across a variety of integrations for all three integration types.

The endpoint will give analysts a better idea of the loan obligations a company may have by identifying their loan transactions and loan repayments.
The amount of a loan a company has paid off and the number of loans a company has.

The endpoint can show:
- The loan drawdowns a company has
- The loan repayments made by a company
- The interest rate for a loan drawdown (where possible)

Make sure you have synced a company recently before calling the endpoint.

## Prerequisites
The company must have either at least one Accounting/Banking/Commerce data connection linked and fully synced with the mandatory data types listed below.

Accounting data connection:
- JournalEntries
- Chart of Accounts

Banking data connection:
- Banking Accounts
- Banking Transactions

Commerce data connection:
- Commerce Transactions

If the company does not have a any of these connections, then an error will be thrown.

While Codat supports most integrations, there is a minority that is not supported.
