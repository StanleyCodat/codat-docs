## Introduction to Loan Transactions endpoint
Loan data is often not uniform, spread across a variety of integrations and of different types.
These loans are often hard to identify, analyse and group.
Manually going through data and identifying loans is very time consuming and repetitive. This can also introduce room for human error.

Our Loan Transactions endpoint can identify loans for a company's accounting, banking and commerce integrations. 
It can work across a variety of integrations for all three integration types.

The endpoint will you get a better idea of the loan obligations a compnay may have by identifying their loan transactions and loan repyaments.
The amount of a loan a company has paid off and the number of loans a company has.

The endpoint can show:
- The loan drawdowns a company has
- The loan repayments made by a company
- The interest rate for a loan drawdown (where possible)

Codat suggests that you make sure a company has been recently synced before hitting the endpoint.

## Prerequisites
The company must have either at least one Accounting/Banking/Commerce data connection linked and fully synced with the mandatory data types listed below.

Accounting data connection:
- JournalEntries
- Chart of Accounts

Banking data connection:
- Banking Accounts
- Banking Transactions

Commerce data connection:
- Commerce Transactions

If the company does not have a any of these connections, then an error will be thrown.

Whilst Codat support most integrations, there are a minority which are not supported.
