Our updated version of Enhanced Financials reduces the need for highly manual, time-consuming, and repetitive interpretation of SMB account names. 

With Codat, lenders can automate financial statement analysis using our fully standardized profit and loss statement and balance sheet.

_Enhanced Profit and Loss Accounts_ and _Enhanced Balance Sheet Accounts_ endpoints return a list of accounts enriched with the latest version of categorization. 

You can explore these endpoints further:
