Our Enhanced Financials Excel report gives you the same data you'd get from the [Enhanced Financials endpoints](/assess/enhanced-financials/overview), but in an Excel workbook.  You can use the report to test some companies and familiarise yourself with the data before building to the equivalent API endpoints.

This report contains an output of the following feature:

- [Enhanced profit and loss accounts](/assess/enhanced-financials/profit-and-loss-accounts)
- [Enhanced balance sheet accounts](/assess/enhanced-financials/balance-sheet-accounts)

## Prerequisites

The report contains data based on the data types you have enabled. If a data type is missing, the data associated with it will be omitted.

The report requires an accounting integration with the following data types enabled:

- Accounts
- Profit and Loss
- Balance Sheet

## Generating the report

You can generate the Enhanced Financials Excel report using the API or the Codat Portal (for details, see [Reports](/assess/portal/overview#reports)). The [Assess reports in Excel](/assess/excel/overview) article describes how to generate and download the report using the API.

## Using the report

To get the most out of the report, try creating a pivot table and grouping the data by category Level 1-5 to replicate a financial statement view. You can also create formulas to calculate financial ratios.

### Metrics template

We have created a [Metrics Template](/documents/assess-metrics.xlsx) that allows users to paste data from the enhanced financials report to calculate key financial metrics and ratios.
